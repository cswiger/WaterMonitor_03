# WaterMonitor_03
esp8266 sketch to monitor GPIO2 for a water sensor and trigger an sms text 

Uses this sensor   https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FZRKLIE/
and an esp8266-01  with nexmo account setup for fastest sms texts.

I have another version that just manually sends email via smtp2.go to send a text via my cell carrier's email gateway.
